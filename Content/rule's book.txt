|  1. Two players, the king's side vs attackers. There are twice as many attackers as defenders.                                                |

|  2. The attackers' (Wotan's) side moves first, then the players take turns.                                                                  |

|     All pieces except the king are captured if sandwiched between two enemy pieces, or between an enemy piece and a restricted square.          |
|     The two enemy pieces should be on the square above and below or on the squares left and right of the attacked piece, i.e., not diagonally. |
|     A piece is only captured if the trap is closed by the aggressor's move. It is therefore permitted to move in between two enemy pieces.    |
|     The king may take part in captures.                                                                                                        |

|     Restricted squares may only be occupied by the king. The central restricted square is called the throne. It is allowed for the king to    |
|     re-enter the throne, and all pieces may pass through the throne when it is empty.                                                         |
|     Restricted squares are hostile, which means they can replace one of the two pieces taking part in a capture. The throne is always hostile |
|     to the attackers, but only hostile to the defenders when it is empty.                                                                    |
|     The four corner squares are also restricted and hostile, just like the throne                                                             |
|     The board edge is NOT hostile.                                                                                                              |

|  6. King's side win (White)                                                                                                                    |
|     If the king reaches any corner square, the king has escaped and his side wins:                                                            |

|     The giants win if they can capture the king.                                                                                              |
|     The king is captured when the giants surround him on all four cardinal points, except when he is next to the throne.                       |
|     If on a square next to the throne, the giants must occupy the three remaining squares around him.                                          |
|                                                                                                                                               |
|     The king cannot be captured on the board edge, UNLESS he is the only white piece remaining on the board and is completely surrounded by     |
|     black (i.e. rule 8).                                                                                                                       |
